      "        Seriously, I love my Keurig. I love the convenience and the coffees. But what I don't love is buying $50 dollars worth of coffee every month. I tried the filter that Keurig gave me with my Platinum B70 model and it made my awesome Guatemalan Coffee I used to brew the \"old fashion way\" into a watered down mess no matter how fine I ground the bean or how much I reduced the cup size. I was skeptical about buying another kcup filter when I saw this offered on Superstore, but the video add on the ekobrew website had me sold. I bought the ekobrew Cup before it was available for sale with high hopes, and it has totally lived up to my expectations! My freshly ground coffee tastes better than any Kcup I have ever had! I forgot how good some of the beans I bought were. No Joke. If you are like me and have a few roasts of beans you just love and don't feel like breaking the bank trying every kcup under the sun to find blends that please you then get it. You won't be sorry. The only negative part is you have to rinse it out but that is no big deal. Just pop the top and tap it on the sink and the grinds come out then rinse. No scrubbing or anything. I may buy another to have one handy to fill while the other is brewing since I make about 3 Kcups worth of coffee in the morning to fill for two travel mugs for the wife and I. THANK YOU ekobrew! …\n",

      "        There's a recipe on the back of the package for rice flour muffins - I follow it to make the best banana-blueberry muffins that are light and fluffy - just as good as wheat! I usually mix the white rice flour with equal parts brown rice flour, and instead of 1/2 cup fruit juice, I use 3 overly ripe bananas - the recipe hasn't failed me yet! Even better: they freeze really well, so I can make a double batch and pop them into the freezer for later. I've also tried the pie crust recipe - it's OK - instead of rolling it out and trying to get it into the pie pan (it breaks apart too much) I just mix into a ball and smoosh it into the pie pan. …\n",

      "        Cola is by far my favorite drink. My wife and I usually have a debate of Pepsi vs. Coke, me preferring Coke, and neither one of us will ever win. So I saw this bottle and was very hopeful to find something which would stop the argument once and for all. Fentiman's cola comes in a nice looking bottle, it has an old fashioned feel to it, and even the name \"Curiosity\" beckons something forth from the early 1900s -- a certain naivit&amp;eacute; if you will. When I first opened the bottle I found that it was not as heavily carbonated as say my favorite Coke or my wife's Pepsi, something which might prove a boon to the product. I sniffed it, and it had a distinct smell of cheap no-brand colas (to which I have resorted in the past during periods of smaller wallets). That's not to say it was bad, it just is what it is. I took a sip of the liquid and managed to get out the words \"This really isn't too--\" before my face contorted in waves of disgust. It was one of the foulest sodas I have tasted to date, and that includes the old Tab drink. For the first couple of seconds it just tastes like a cheaper cola, but then the aftertaste hits you, and it is vile. I would get this for someone for a gag gift (emphasis on the word \"gag\" here), but I will never purchase another bottle for my own sake. Having spent money on the bottle, however, I did not wish to waste it, so I guzzled the whole thing (this is where the limited carbonation indeed became a boon for the product). This did turn out, in the end, to be a mistake, as every time the carbonation would force a burp I'd get nothing of the \"not so bad\" taste from the first couple of seconds, but instead I got all the horrible aftertaste. This may be close to what Cola once was. It is, however, important to remember that it has evolved for a few reasons, and taste is one of those reasons. Give me a Coke any day, or even a Pepsi. …\n",

      "        I do not understand the people who say that they cook with this product. It has a strong coconut flavor and aroma that would only be good for deserts, if you want that. I tried it in split pea soup that has a pretty strong aroma of its own, and found it quite unworkable. Also, coconut \"oil\" is one of the most saturated fats in nature, so I'd rather just use butter for most things since it is not nearly as saturated. Yes, it may not contain trans fat, but that's about all that you can say for it. You cannot \"eat it out of the jar\" as someone avered because it is so saturated at outside air temperatures that it is rock-hard. It may possibly work for psoriasis or as a hand cream, but remember that your body will smell strongly like coconut if you use it as a salve. I'm pretty skeptical right now, but I have two jars so I am trying some non-culinary things to use it up. …\n",

      "        After trying Artisana's Cacao Bliss, I wanted to sample some of the manufacturer's other products. I really enjoy macademia nuts and thought the Macadamia with Cashews butter would be a good product to try. This product is made with just two ingredients -- macadamias and cashews -- and I can say that this product demonstrates what a healthy, good for you food should taste like. Unlike Cacao Bliss, which is a solid product at room temperature, the macadamia cashew butter is easily retrieved from the container. There was some oil separation but after a little stirring, one can take a butter knife and quickly spread the substance on a piece of toast or apple slices; the product is incredibly smooth out of the jar. When looking at the butter, you will see little pieces of nuts which makes this product product have some texture. This macadamia cashew butter is not as chunky as most chunky peanut butters; the chunks in this product are much finer. I found the flavor to be very much influenced by the raw cashews and actually considered my jar to be more of a cashew butter than a macadamia butter. It is recommended that this product be refrigerated for a longer life. While not noted explicitly on the product's label, I could see nothing that would contradict my belief that this is a vegan product. There is no milk, honey, eggs or other animal-based substances that go into the formulation of this product. According to the product packaging, this product is \"made in a facility that processes tree nuts and soy, but does not process peanuts, gluten, dairy, cholesterol or GMO's.\" This is my second good experience with Artisana products. For holiday gift giving, I'm definitely going to be packaging several of Artisana's products in gift baskets. They are tasty, natural and unique. This product is made in the United States …\n",

      "        I'd been hearing about Zevia and finally got to try some of each flavor. Due to an inability to process sugar (can't \"cheat\" because I get instantly sick), and headache problems from aspartame and sucralose, I've been unable to drink soda for several years. I figured I'd rather be healthy, feel good, and drink water or tea than have a drink of pop and feel awful, so I abstained. So I was excited to find Zevia. Zevia is nothing short of wonderful. When I could still drink pop, I'd tried all kinds of artisan types like Jones, Virgil's etc. so it doesn't bother me a bit that it's not a Coke clone (but it's not far off either). It's still got a wonderful, true cola flavor--a fantasia flavor of vanilla, citrus, and cinnamon, like all true colas. Plenty of fizz that lasts the whole can. As far as aftertaste goes, I've never tasted a soda that didn't have some kind--and that I couldn't get used to. This probably has less aftertaste than anything I've tasted, other than straight cane-sugar. If anything it's a sweet, rather than the usual acidic, aftertaste. The opinions of the others in my family are similar. My husband, who is very picky when it comes to diet cola, loved it and claimed my second can of it. He's been trying to get away from his diet Coke addiction for a couple of years. My kids loved all the flavors they tried. They're not normally allowed to drink soda at all, and are thrilled there is finally something out there I'll allow them to have once in awhile. It's selling for about $1 a can, which is less than the other \"stevia-supplemented\" soda out there (Virgil's is around $2 a bottle). I imagine that as this takes off, that price will come down. And it should take off. It's just as good as the not-so-good-for-you sodas. …\n",

      "        I eat well. I read a lot of research on health. I'm a Medline junkie. I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs. Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.) None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life. That is, until Natural Calm. This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically! Here are the things this supplement has helped with: Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night. Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed. Also increased my ability to deal with difficult \"crisis\" situations. Mood--- Made me generally happier. Decreased muscle cramping and soreness. Improved gums and teeth. Improved hair loss. Improved digestion and transit time. Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right?? Me too! But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without. It has made that important an improvement in my life. It is almost like a miracle. Really. There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume. Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume. In America this ratio is about 4 to 1. Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1. I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day. (Try \"The Magnesium Factor\" by Margaret Seelig or \"The Magnesium Miracle\" by Carolyn Dean here on Superstore if you want more science of magnesium.) I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two. You probably won't need that long. I noticed an improvement in two days. A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement. If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results. Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want. Here's wishing you great health! …\n",

      "        After drinking 1 cup of coffee daily for 30+ yrs, suddenly it seemed to eat my stomach up, even with the large amount of cream I add to it. I discovered breakfast blend by researching the available k-cups at the Keuring website where they give complete descriptions of each blend. Breakfast blend does not bother my stomach. I can't rave about the coffee and say it's the best cup I have ever tasted but it serves it's pupose. I believe Superstore has the lowest price you will ever find. The best deal for any K-cup is the box of 50. If you subscribe to it, you can choose to recieve it automatically at one or serveral months intervals and save 15%. You can cancel the subscription any time. It comes in a nice sturdy reuseable box too! I also buy Green Mountain's Half-caff coffee, also sold at Superstore. If you have a sensitive stomach or are sensitive to caffeine, this may also be a good choice for you. ps....Everyone loves our Keurig. Most people have to buy one after experiencing ours. We even have to take it with us in our RV. If coffee drinkers in your household prefer different blends or flavored blends (which linger in the pot) or you entertain, or just have a very picky coffee drinker who must have his coffee just brewed and then throw the rest out (my husband) this is the pot for you! …\n",

      "        If the only chai you know is from a chai flavored latte at a coffee shop, this might be a good tea for you. If you have an Indo-Pakistani family like me, the first thing you'll say after tasting this is \"this is NOT chai tea.\" There isn't even the slightest hint of cardamon in this tea. As it is, it should be called \"spicy clove tea.\" This tea is heavily seasoned with cloves--I can't agree with any of the reviews that talk about cinnamon or other spices. It's just cloves, cloves, and more cloves. I guess that's what I get for looking for a simple chai-flavored tea. Real chai contains Milk, Sugar, loose black tea, cardamon, and a tiny amount of other spices according to region. Cardamon and strong tea should be the dominant flavors. Check the wikipedia article on Masala Chai for the original chai and how the American chai is a just a strange revision. I'm sure that my fellow sugar-loving Americans would love to have a cup of super-sweet traditional chai, so I don't really understand why the flavor has been changed so drastically. I was hoping to add milk and sugar to this to get a \"traditional\" Indian Chai, but I'm going to have to try again with another brand. For all the people out there who know what Indo-Pakistani Chai tastes like, I'll be reviewing each of the \"chai\" K-Cups according to how they resemble the original. …\n",

      "        This honey was suggested for my young son's warts. He had eczema as a baby and rapidly spreading warts is a common link to people with eczema. At our last count he had over 25 warts on his two hands. We tried everything to get rid of them from over-the-counter products to several doctor visits to 'freeze' the warts. Nothing was successful. Finally a plastic surgeon recommended this honey because of its success in patients with eczema and psoriasis. Within a week of using the honey the warts were visibly much smaller. Now that the honey is gone so are the warts! We are so pleased that our little guy didn't have to go through any more painful treatments! It is a miracle! …\n",

      "        This is a great product. It's not as finicky as arrowroot powder which if heated too long will not thicken. I made the recipe on the back with some additional changes and it was fabulous!! My kids loved it and it's a great substitute for the very unhealthy cans of cherry pie filling on the store shelfs. Here's what's on the back: QUICK APPLE CHERRY PUDDING (I call my new reciipe \"Cherry Pie Filling\"- used for cobbler) 4 C EDEN organic apple cherry juice (I used Santacruz unpast. OG apple juice) (I also added 1 1/2 Tbl of Dynamic Health Black Cherry Juice Concentrate) 4 Tbl EDEN Kuzu dissolved in 5 Tbl cold water Place all in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and stir constatnly until thick. Kuzu is also good for sothing the stomach and strengthening the intestines. this would be a great thing to give your child if he's suffering from a tummy ache. …\n",

      "        This year I took a chance on this chocolate. I normally use a block of chocolate but the callets are so much easier to work with and melt even more easily. The one kilogram bag is enough to make one recipe of truffles. You will have some left over for chocolate chip cookies. Ingredients: unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor. May contain traces of milk protein. Here is the recipe I made up for chocolates during the holiday season. The addition of cinnamon is really delicious. Fresh Cream Truffles with Cinnamon A double boiler is not recommended for melting the chocolate. Use your crockery cooker for the best results. The creamy ganache (ga-nosh) is dipped in melted chocolate and should be stored in the refrigerator. Bring the truffles to room temperature an hour before serving. Ganache 6 ounces Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets 3/4 cup whipping cream 1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon Dipping Chocolate 1 pound Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets Parchment paper 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1. Place the 6 ounces chocolate in a medium sized bowl. 2. Heat the cream just until it comes to a boil. Pour over chocolate. Stir until the chocolate melts. Cool to 90 degrees. 3. Cream all the butter in a deep bowl with a wooden spoon. Stir in tablespoonfuls of cooled chocolate, beating well after each addition. Mixture should be creamy. If the butter starts to melt, the chocolate is still too warm. Lastly, stir in the vanilla and cinnamon. 4. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Fit a piping bag with a size 807 decorating tip. Pipe a round the size of a quarter onto parchment paper, start piping second level then lift. Place in the freezer to chill for 20 minutes. 5. Place the one pound dipping chocolate in a 6-quart crockery cooker, heat on low. Stir a few times until all chocolate has melted. Turn cooker off when chocolate has melted. The temperature should not go above 120 degrees. Pour chocolate into a medium bowl. 8. Mix the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon together. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a truffle fork to dip chocolates. When all chocolates have been dipped use a sifter to sprinkle cinnamon confectioners' sugar over truffles. 9. Place truffles in the freezer for 20 minutes to set chocolate. Then, keep them in the refrigerator until about an hour before serving. Happy Holidays! ~The Rebecca Review …\n",

For people who dislike flavored coffee this might be a good choice (though why would those people be looking at this product I'm not sure...)
